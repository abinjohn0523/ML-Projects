# Crab Age Prediction

## Analysis Type: Regression

The dataset is used to estimate the age of the crab based on the physical attributes. Its a great starting point for classical regression analysis and feature engineering and understand the impact of feature engineering in Data Science domain.
 
 For a commercial crab farmer knowing the right age of the crab helps them decide if and when to harvest the crabs. Beyond a certain age, there is negligible growth in crab's physical characteristics and hence, it is important to time the harvesting to reduce cost and increase profit. The goal of the dataset is:

1. Exploratory data analysis - Understand how different physical features change with age.
2. Feature Engineering - Define new features using a combination of given data points to help improve model accuracy.
3. Regression Model - Build a regression model to predict the age of the Crab.
4. Deployment codes
